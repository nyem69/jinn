# Contributing to Jinn

Thanks for your interest in contributing. This guide covers the basics.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 22 or later
- pnpm 10+
- [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) (`npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`)

## Development Setup

1. Fork and clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
3. Initialize Jinn (one-time — builds all packages and creates `~/.jinn`):
   ```bash
   pnpm setup
   ```
   This is safe to re-run; it skips files that already exist.
4. Start development mode:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```
   This starts the gateway on `:7777` (auto-restarts on source changes) and the
   Next.js dev server on `:3000` (hot reload). Both must be running for the
   web dashboard to work.
